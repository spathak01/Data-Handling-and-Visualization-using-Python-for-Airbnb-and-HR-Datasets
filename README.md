Data visualization is an essential tool for professionals across various fields. It can be used by educators to display student performance, by researchers exploring advancements in AI, or by business executives looking to communicate insights to stakeholders. In the context of big data projects, data visualization is crucial in allowing users to gain a better understanding of their vast amounts of data, identify new patterns, and detect errors.

This GitHub repository showcases Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to effectively visualize data using Python. The project specifically focuses on two datasets: the AirBnb dataset and the HR dataset. The notebooks provide practical examples of how to clean, manipulate, and visualize data in a meaningful way, allowing users to extract insights and make informed decisions.
